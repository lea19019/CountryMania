# Country Mania App Overview

Country Mania is a SPA (Single Page App) that fetches country data from the REST Countries API. Currently you are able to see all the countries and their flags
inside home and is divided by a pagination engine. When clicking into a country the data inside the container changes and now the country data will be displayed. 

The app has a 'Countries' tab where you'll see all the countries listed inside their respective region. A search engine is implemented and error handling as well. One function to highlight, every time you reload the page or click on home the order of the countries will randomly change.

As a Software Developer I wanted to create an app that would allow me to practice the MVC architecture on SPA apps. With that on mind, I also wanted to pullish my OOP skills and implement Try and Catch functionalities. Another skill I wanted to practice was to modularize my code while consuming APIs. I used SASS for my styling and Parcel to bundle the code.

This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey and you can give a look to both of my sites, which are uploaded here on GitHub, these are the links:
